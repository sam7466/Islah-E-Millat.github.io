                        The Salah is the second pillar after Shahada – <em> Ashadu an la ilaha illa illa-ilah, wa ashadu
                            anna muhammadan rasul ullah </em> meaning, “there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the
                        messenger of Allah”.
                    </p>
                    <p>The word salah (in Arabic: ‏صلاة‎) is used by Muslims across the globe and refers to the daily
                        prayer. But prayer is also said by Arabic words “dua” and “dhikr” both meaning prayer. The
                        actual meaning of the word in Salah or Salat in Arabic means connection, contact, or
                        communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is referring to establishing a connection with the creator, Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala. By
                        praying Salah you are seeking nearness to Allah and are nurturing that relationship through
                        worship. Allah has made prayer mandatory for all Muslims for many reason.

                    <p>The rewards of praying Salat are many and they are described in a number of different verses of
                        the Quran. There are over 67+ verses or quotes about salah listed in the Quran which you will
                        learn in this article.
                    </p>


                    <p>It’s important we read the Quran in Arabic but we must also seek to understand the message it
                        conveys. These verses contain importance, blessings, and even warns us of the dangers to missing
                        the prayer. </p>


                    <p><strong>VERSES OF THE QURAN ABOUT SALAH</strong></p>

                    <p>Here are the verses of the Quran which mention Salah in chronological order:</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"> <span>Surah Baqarah</span>:</p>


                    <p>
                        2:3-4 Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for
                        them, And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed
                        before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].</p>


                    <p>
                        2:43 And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].
                    </p>

                    <p>2:45 And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly
                        submissive [to Allah]
                    </p>

                    <p>2:83 And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them],
                        “Do not worship except Allah ; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy.
                        And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah.” Then you turned away,
                        except a few of you, and you were refusing.</p>

                    <p>2:110 And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves – you
                        will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah of what you do, is Seeing.</p>


                    <p>2:153 O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the
                        patient.</p>

                    <p>2:177 Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true]
                        righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the
                        prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the
                        traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and
                        gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in
                        poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those
                        who are the righteous.</p>


                    <p>2:238 Maintain with care the [obligatory] prayers and [in particular] the middle prayer and stand
                        before Allah, devoutly obedient.</p>

                    <p>
                        2:239 And if you fear [an enemy, then pray] on foot or riding. But when you are secure, then
                        remember Allah [in prayer], as He has taught you that which you did not [previously] know.
                    </p>

                    <p>2:277 Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zakah will
                        have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they
                        grieve.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah An-Nisa</span>:</p>

                    <p>4:43 O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know
                        what you are saying or in a state of janabah, except those passing through [a place of prayer],
                        until you have washed [your whole body]. And if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes
                        from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water, then seek
                        clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it]. Indeed, Allah is ever Pardoning
                        and Forgiving.</p>

                    <p>4:77 Have you not seen those who were told, “Restrain your hands [from fighting] and establish
                        prayer and give zakah”? But then when fighting was ordained for them, at once a party of them
                        feared men as they fear Allah or with [even] greater fear. They said, “Our Lord, why have You
                        decreed upon us fighting? If only You had postponed [it for] us for a short time.” Say, The
                        enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for he who fears Allah. And
                        injustice will not be done to you, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed].”
                    </p>

                    <p>4:101 And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the
                        prayer, [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you. Indeed,
                        the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.</p>

                    <p>4:102 And when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer]
                        with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position]
                        behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray
                        with you, taking precaution and carrying their arms. Those who disbelieve wish that you would
                        neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one [single] attack.
                        But there is no blame upon you, if you are troubled by rain or are ill, for putting down your
                        arms, but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating
                        punishment.</p>

                    <p>4:103 And when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on
                        your sides. But when you become secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. Indeed, prayer has been
                        decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.</p>

                    <p>4:142-143 Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive Allah, but He is deceiving them. And when
                        they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, showing [themselves to] the people and not remembering
                        Allah except a little, Wavering between them, [belonging] neither to the believers nor to the
                        disbelievers. And whoever Allah leaves astray – never will you find for him a way.</p>

                    <p>4:162 But those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed
                        to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you. And the establishers of prayer
                        [especially] and the givers of zakah and the believers in Allah and the Last Day – those We will
                        give a great reward.</p>


                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Maidah</span>:</p>



                    <p>5:6 O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms
                        to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a
                        state of janabah, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes
                        from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then seek
                        clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. Allah does not intend to make difficulty
                        for you, but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.
                    </p>

                    <p>5:12 And Allah had already taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We delegated from
                        among them twelve leaders. And Allah said, “I am with you. If you establish prayer and give
                        zakah and believe in My messengers and support them and loan Allah a goodly loan, I will surely
                        remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever of
                        you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.”</p>


                    <p>5:55 Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed –
                        those who establish prayer and give zakah, and they bow [in worship].</p>

                    <p>5:58 And when you call to prayer, they take it in ridicule and amusement. That is because they
                        are a people who do not use reason.
                    </p>



                    <p>5:91 Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling
                        and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?</p>

                    <p>5:106 O you who have believed, testimony [should be taken] among you when death approaches one of
                        you at the time of bequest – [that of] two just men from among you or two others from outside if
                        you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you. Detain them
                        after the prayer and let them both swear by Allah if you doubt [their testimony, saying], “We
                        will not exchange our oath for a price, even if he should be a near relative, and we will not
                        withhold the testimony of Allah . Indeed, we would then be of the sinful.”</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Anam</span>:</p>

                    <p>6:72 And to establish prayer and fear Him.” And it is He to whom you will be gathered.</p>

                    <p>6:92 And this is a Book which We have sent down, blessed and confirming what was before it, that
                        you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter
                        believe in it, and they are maintaining their prayers.</p>

                    <p>6:162 Say, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord
                        of the worlds.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-A’raf</span>:</p>

                    <p>7:170 But those who hold fast to the Book and establish prayer – indeed, We will not allow to be
                        lost the reward of the reformers.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Anfal</span>:</p>

                    <p>8:3 The ones who establish prayer, and from what We have provided them, they spend.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Taubah</span>:</p>

                    <p>9:5 And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and
                        capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they
                        should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is
                        Forgiving and Merciful.</p>

                    <p>9:11 But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, then they are your brothers in
                        religion; and We detail the verses for a people who know.</p>

                    <p>9:18 The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last
                        Day and establish prayer and give zakah and do not fear except Allah, for it is expected that
                        those will be of the [rightly] guided.</p>



                    <p>9:54 And what prevents their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they have
                        disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger and that they come not to prayer except while they are
                        lazy and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling.
                    </p>

                    <p>9:71 The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right
                        and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.
                        Those – Allah will have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Yunus</span>:</p>


                    <p>10:87 And We inspired to Moses and his brother, “Settle your people in Egypt in houses and make
                        your houses [facing the] qiblah and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers.”
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Hud</span>:</p>

                    <p>11:87 They said, “O Shu’ayb, does your prayer command you that we should leave what our fathers
                        worship or not do with our wealth what we please? Indeed, you are the forbearing, the
                        discerning!”</p>

                    <p>11:114 And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed,
                        good deeds do away with misdeeds. That is a reminder for those who remember.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Hud</span>:</p>

                    <p>13: 22 And those who are patient, seeking the countenance of their Lord, and establish prayer and
                        spend from what We have provided for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good –
                        those will have the good consequence of [this] home –</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ibrahim</span>:</p>

                    <p>14:31 [O Muhammad], tell My servants who have believed to establish prayer and spend from what We
                        have provided them, secretly and publicly, before a Day comes in which there will be no
                        exchange, nor any friendships.</p>



                    <p>14:37 Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred
                        House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward
                        them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful.</p>

                    <p>14:40 My Lord, make me an establisher of prayer, and [many] from my descendants. Our Lord, and
                        accept my supplication.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Isra</span>:</p>

                    <p>17:78 Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] until the darkness of the
                        night and [also] the Qur’an of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed.</p>



                    <p>17:79 And from [part of] the night, pray with it as additional [worship] for you; it is expected
                        that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station.</p>

                    <p>17:110 Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call – to Him
                        belong the best names.” And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or [too] quietly but seek
                        between that an [intermediate] way.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Maryam</span>:</p>

                    <p>19:30-32 [Jesus] said, “Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made
                        me a prophet. And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah
                        as long as I remain alive And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched
                        tyrant.</p>

                    <p>19:55 And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zakah and was to his Lord pleasing.</p>

                    <p>19:59-60 But there came after them successors who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they
                        are going to meet evil – Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will
                        enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ta-Ha</span>:</p>

                    <p>20:14 Indeed, I am Allah . There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My
                        remembrance.</p>

                    <p>20:132 And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not
                        for provision; We provide for you, and the [best] outcome is for [those of] righteousness.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Muzzamil</span>:</p>

                    <p>21:73 And We made them leaders guiding by Our command. And We inspired to them the doing of good
                        deeds, establishment of prayer, and giving of zakah; and they were worshippers of Us.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Hajj</span>:</p>

                    <p>22:25 Who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts are fearful, and [to] the patient over what has
                        afflicted them, and the establishers of prayer and those who spend from what We have provided
                        them.</p>

                    <p>22:41 [And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give
                        zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to Allah belongs the outcome of
                        [all] matters.</p>

                    <p>22:78 And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed
                        upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. Allah
                        named you “Muslims” before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger
                        may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give
                        zakah and hold fast to Allah . He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and
                        excellent is the helper.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Mu’minun</span>:</p>

                    <p>23:1-5 Certainly will the believers have succeeded: They who are during their prayer humbly
                        submissive And they who turn away from ill speech And they who are observant of zakah And they
                        who guard their private parts</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah An-Nur</span>:</p>

                    <p>24:37 [Are] men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of Allah and
                        performance of prayer and giving of zakah. They fear a Day in which the hearts and eyes will
                        [fearfully] turn about –</p>

                    <p>24:41 Do you not see that Allah is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and
                        [by] the birds with wings spread [in flight]? Each [of them] has known his [means of] prayer and
                        exalting [Him], and Allah is Knowing of what they do.</p>
                    <p>24:56 And establish prayer and give zakah and obey the Messenger – that you may receive mercy.
                    </p>
                    <p>24:58 O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess and those who have not
                        [yet] reached puberty among you ask permission of you [before entering] at three times: before
                        the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon and after the night
                        prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you. There is no blame upon you nor upon them
                        beyond these [periods], for they continually circulate among you – some of you, among others.
                        Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses; and Allah is Knowing and Wise.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah An-Naml</span>:</p>
                    <p>27:3 Who establish prayer and give zakah, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ankabut</span>:</p>
                    <p>29:45 Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer.
                        Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And
                        Allah knows that which you do.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ar-Rum</span>:</p>
                    <p>30:31 [Adhere to it], turning in repentance to Him, and fear Him and establish prayer and do not
                        be of those who associate others with Allah</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Luqman</span>:</p>
                    <p>31:4 Who establish prayer and give zakah, and they, of the Hereafter, are certain [in faith].</p>
                    <p>31:17 O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over
                        what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ahzab</span>:</p>
                    <p>33:33 And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former
                        times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah
                        intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet’s] household,
                        and to purify you with [extensive] purification.</p>
                    <p>33:56 Allah sends His Salat (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad
                        SAW) and also His angels too (ask Allah to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your
                        Salat on (ask Allah to bless) him (Muhammad SAW), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the
                        Islamic way of greeting (salutation i.e. AsSalamu ‘Alaikum).</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Fatir</span>:</p>
                    <p>35:18 And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls
                        [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a
                        close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and have established prayer.
                        And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his soul. And to Allah
                        is the [final] destination.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ghafir</span>:</p>
                    <p>40:55 So be patient, [O Muhammad]. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And ask forgiveness for
                        your sin and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ash-Shura</span>:</p>
                    <p>42:38-40 And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship, and whose affairs are
                        a matter of counsel, and who spend of what We have bestowed on them, And those who, when tyranny
                        strikes them, they defend themselves, And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like
                        it, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation – his reward is [due] from Allah . Indeed, He
                        does not like wrongdoers.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Mujadilah</span>:</p>
                    <p>58:13 Have you feared to present before your consultation charities? Then when you do not and
                        Allah has forgiven you, then [at least] establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His
                        Messenger. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Jumu’ah</span>:</p>
                    <p>62:9 O you who have believed, when [the adhan] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu’ah
                        [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade. That is better for you, if
                        you only knew.</p>
                    <p>62:10 And when the prayer has been concluded, disperse within the land and seek from the bounty
                        of Allah, and remember Allah often that you may succeed.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Ma’arij</span>:</p>
                    <p>70:19-23 Indeed, mankind was created anxious: When evil touches him, impatient, And when good
                        touches him, withholding [of it], Except the observers of prayer – Those who are constant in
                        their prayer</p>
                    <p>70:34-35 And those who [carefully] maintain their prayer: They will be in gardens, honored.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Muzzamil</span>:</p>
                    <p>73:20 Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muhammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the
                        night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And Allah
                        determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be
                        able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the
                        Qur’an. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling
                        throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause
                        of Allah. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan Allah a
                        goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves – you will find it with Allah. It
                        is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and
                        Merciful.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Muddaththir</span>:</p>
                    <p>74:40-45 [Who will be] in gardens, questioning each other About the criminals, [And asking them],
                        “What put you into Saqar (hell)?” They will say, “We were not of those who prayed, Nor did we
                        used to feed the poor. And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged [in it],
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><span>Surah Al-Bayyina</span>:</p>
                    <p>98:5 And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion,
                        inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakah. And that is the correct religion.
