                        <strong>Sabr – More Than Patience</strong>
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        For many Muslims, the term <em style="    background: #FFECB9">sabr</em> has become synonymous with the word “patience.” However, the beauty of the Arabic language is that many Arabic words, such as <em style="    background: #FFECB9">sabr</em>, <em style="    background: #FFECB9"> ihsan</em>, <em style="    background: #FFECB9">taqwa</em>, and more, have such a vast scope that there is no single word in the English language that equates to them. Focusing on the concept of sabr, the term has a much broader meaning than patience.
                    </p>
                    <p>As Muslims we understand the importance of displaying the attribute of <em style="    background: #FFECB9">sabr</em> in our lives. Along with being a part of one of Allah’s 99 names (Aṣ-Sabūr), Allah has commanded the believers to embody this characteristic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What exactly does Sabr mean?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Sabr (in arabic صَبْرٌ) is an Islamic concept that makes up one of the two parts of faith
                        (shukr
                        being the other). It’s often translated as patience, but Sabr more accurately depicts being
                        persistence and persevering. It includes aspects of being self-disciplined, remaining
                        spiritually steadfast, showing fortitude especially when faced with adversity or setbacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the English language, the word “patience” is seen as a reactive word with a negative connotation, meaning that you are patient after a trial or test strikes. Some people go as far as to say that patience means sitting back and praying while hoping for a miracle to fix the situation. However, this is simply not true Islamic patience. True <em style="background: #FFECB9">sabr</em> (just like <em style="background: #FFECB9">tawwakul</em>) is an active and positive attribute.</p>
                    <p>The linguistic definition of <em style="background: #FFECB9">sabr</em> is to restrain or stop, and the literal definition of the word (depending on how it’s used) is perseverance or steadfastness. In that sense, one possible definition that scholars have given is that <em style="background: #FFECB9">sabr</em> is the perseverance to stay steadfast regardless of circumstances.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What Does Sabr Look like?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Sabr is about suppressing that loud and obnoxious voice in your head that wants to unleash
                        it’s
                        wrath towards others when they inconvenience you or insult you.</p>
                    <p>Sabr is about maintaining and upholding one’s love and loyalty to Allah under any
                        circumstance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sabr is about tightening your bond with Allah every time you feel pain, suffering or hurt as
                        opposed to straying away. </p>
                    <p>Sabr is keeping your head when all around you people are losing theirs.</p>
                    <p>The Importance of keeping sabr and making it a daily practice is a beautiful and powerful
                        concept
                        of Islam. It’s a way of living that tends to bring peace and tranquility to one’s life. Sabr
                        is
                        about checking your emotions and keeping them under control to prevent you from engaging in
                        activities that may not be deemed righteous. If we’re being truthful, there’s likely been a
                        number of times where in retrospect we may have said or done things which we now regret. In
                        these moments, it would have paid greatly to have practiced Sabar.</p>
                    <p>But first we’ll explore many verses and quotes about sabr and it’s importance from famous
                        Islamic
                        figures as well as referring to the <a href="/Html/Quran.html" style="text-decoration: none

                    <p>Desires make slaves out of kings and patience makes king out of slaves. Imam Ghazali</p>

                    <p>Two things define you: Your patience when you have nothing and your attitude when you have
                        everything. (Imam Ali)</p>

                    <p>Ya Allah give me Sabr when things don”t go my way. You know what is best for me, So help me
                        accept what you have decreed for me and make me among your grateful servants. Allahuma
                        Ameen.</p>

                    <p>A beautiful lesson from the story of Prophet Yusuf, is that even if the people closest to you
                        in your life betray you, as long as you keep trust in Allah and show sabr (patience), He
                        will raise your status and open doors for you. Trust Allah.</p>

                    <p>Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting.
                    </p>

                    <p>Through patience, great things are accomplished. – Imam Ali (A.S)</p>

                    <p>Every time People hurt me. I become closer to Allah.</p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/hadees 7.png" alt="Image Error">
                    </p>

                    <p>When the prophet (ﷺ) Says: “Be Patient” remember this advice comes from one who lost both
                        parents and buried six of children during his life.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes Allah stops you because the way you choose is dangerous. He will give you what you
                        need at the perfect time. Just be patient, because the good things come to the people who
                        have Sabr.</p>

                    <p>Sabr is not remaining quiet and letting anger build up inside you. Sabr is to talk about
                        what’s bothering you without losing control of your emotions. Nouman Ali khan.</p>

                    <p>“Never have I dealt with anything more difficult than my own soul, which sometimes helps me
                        and sometimes opposes me.” Imam Al-Ghazali</p>

                    <p>Maybe i’m asking for a drop and Allah wrote for me the ocean.</p>

                    </p>

                    <p>“Patience is of two kinds, patience over what pains you, and patience against what you
                        covet.” Imam Ali</p>

                    <p>“No two things have been combined better than knowledge and patience” Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)
                    </p>

                    <p>“behind every smiling face there is an untold story of sabr”</p>

                    <p>Patience is that the heart does not feel anger towards that which is destined and that the
                        mouth does not complain. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya</p>

                    <h2 id="practice-sabr"><strong>How To Practice Sabr:</strong></h2>

                    <p><strong>TIP #1:</strong> Here’s a technique I find particularly useful for controlling your
                        emotions, begin your day contemplating some of the bad things that <em>can happen</em> to
                        you that will disrupt your inner peace.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>

                    <p>You may be skeptical of this, wouldn’t constantly thinking of negative things make you more
                        uneasy or on edge? Not necessarily.</p>

                    <p>By practicing thinking about ways that people or situations will let you down you can
                        consciously attempt to avoid them from occurring and when they do occur you will not be
                        taken by surprise. By taking the time to see your downfall takes the sting out of the event
                        and gives you the ability to take a backseat and rationalize your way through the emotion.
                        After all why would you be upset about a thing you knew&nbsp;<em>could&nbsp;</em>happen?</p>

                    <p><strong>TIP #2: </strong>Try persuading yourself to desire the things you already have. We
                        all want the latest and greatest stuff, that’s no secret. But if only we could be content to
                        desire the things which are already in our possession would we be more happy with our life.
                        The irony in doing so is we would then save more and be better off financially. Enjoy the
                        good things in life but do not cling or grow dependent on them. Practice giving away to show
                        yourself that your happiness is not contingent on materialistic items that you really do not
                        need. <strong>We often suffer more in imagination then we do in reality. </strong>&nbsp;The
                        Quran even states,&nbsp;Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear (2:286).</p>

                    <p><strong>TIP #3:&nbsp;</strong>Don’t cry over spilt milk. Once the milk has been spilt and
                        washed down the drain no amount of crying, whining, or&nbsp;murmuring would bring the milk
                        back. It’s a simple concept, but difficult to practice. Complaining has no utility besides
                        making you feel sorry for yourself. Instead, learn to say Alhamdulillah for everything(the
                        good and the bad) that happens in your life. It’s your fate and it can’t be any other way
                        than the way it already is.</p>
