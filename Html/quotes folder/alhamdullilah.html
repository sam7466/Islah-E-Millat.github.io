                    <p>Alhamdulillah, Subhanallah, and Allahu-Akbar are short but powerful prayers that are recited by
                        Muslims to show their gratitude towards Allah. In this short article we will cover all aspects
                        of this word from the meaning of Alhamdulillah, to the pronunciation, when to say Alhamdulillah,
                        virtues/ benefits, and lastly we’ll go cover 21 Alhamdulillah Quotes. Let’s begin…
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Alhamdulillah Meaning and Pronunciation</strong></p>

                    <p>Alhamdulillah (also called tahmid or hamdala) is a very short prayer that is repeated as
                        devotional acts praising Allah. This is known as dhikr (zikir). The exact meaning of
                        Alhamdulillah (pronounced “al-ham-doo-li-lah”) means “Praise be to Allah”. Slight variations of
                        this would be: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Thank Allah</li>
                        <li>All Praises and Thanks Be To Allah</li>
                        <li>All Praise is Due To Allah Alone</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>WHEN TO SAY ALHAMDULILLAH</strong></p>

                    <p>Since Alhamdulillah is a prayer used by Muslims to show gratitude towards Allah it can be said at
                        any time. It’s beneficial to remember Allah multiple times a day and to recite these words,
                        there’s no harm in doing so. Generally, it’s used to show appreciation whenever something good
                        happens.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever made a dua to Allah and it come true? This would be a time when you would say
                        Alhamdulillah. It is good to say thanks to the one who made this happen. The real challenge is
                        to say Alhamdulillah when something bad happens because it could always be worse. We don’t know
                        what Allah is saving us from when we perceive something as “bad” or when things don’t go our
                        way.</p>

                    <p><strong>BENEFITS AND VIRTUES OF SAYING ALHAMDULILLAH</strong></p>

                    <p>It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said: “Umm Sulaim came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O
                        Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), teach me some words that I may supplicate with during my prayer.’ He
                        said: ‘Glorify Allah (by saying Subhanallah) ten times, and praise Him (by saying Alhamdulilah)
                        ten times, and magnify Him (by saying Allahu Akbar) ten times, then ask Him for what you need;
                        He will say: ‘Yes, yes.’</p>

                    <p>Grade: Sahih (Darussalam) Reference: Sunan an-Nasa’i 1299 In-book reference: Book 13, Hadith 121
                    </p>

                    <p>The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “There are some words, the reciters of which will never be
                        disappointed. These are: Tasbih [saying ‘Subhan-Allah’ (Allah is free from imperfection)],
                        thirty-three times, Tahmid [saying ‘Al-hamdu lillah’ (praise be to Allah)] thirty-three times
                        and Takbir [saying ‘Allahu Akbar’ (Allah is Greatest)] thirty-four times; and these should be
                        recited after the conclusion of every prescribed prayer</p>

                    <p>[Muslim] Book Riyad as-Salihin Arabic/English book reference: Book 16, Hadith 1420</p>

                    <p><strong>21 ALHAMDULLILAH QUOTES</strong></p>

                    <p>Be conscious and deliberate in thanking Allah, Islam is religion where the intention is
                        important. It’s a simple act that is required when things tend to go our way, to show gratitude
                        to him. In a way, this also keeps your ego controlled and allows you to remain humble. The
                        remainder of this post will contain some Quran verses and Alhamdullilah quotes that further
                        drives home the point to be grateful. </p>

                            the effort to remember Allah will be given ‘what they used to do’. In the Quran, Surah Nahl
                            ayat 97, “Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer, we
                            will surely cause him to live a good life, and we will surely give them their reward [in the

                        <li>“So remember me and I will remember you” Surah Baqarah Verse 152.</li>
                        <li>Surah Fatiha is the first surah of Quran and it begins with “alhamdulillah rabbil alamin”
                            which means “[All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds.” Every time you pray salat
                            you begin by praising Allah, this is a sign of showing of thankfulness and Shukr.</li>
                        <li>“Know that thankfulness is from the highest of stations, and it is higher than patience,
                            fear, and detachment of the world.” Imam Al-Ghazali</li>
                        <li>Thank you Allah for Blessing me much more than I deserve</li>
                        <li>Every pain has a purpose. Every fall has a reason. The Almighty wouldn’t have allowed it to
                            happen. Remember, life is a process. Each part of it is necessary to reach your next
                            milestone. Short cuts won’t work. So embrace whatever He has planned and you’ll rise again!

                    <p><strong>FINAL NOTE:</strong></p>
                    <p>We give to much power to other people’s judgement. If we are constantly comparing ourselves to
                        those around us we are relinquishing control of our happiness. We’re letting external forces
                        dictate our behavior and mood. This does not allow us to be present and appreciate what’s in
                        front of us. To harbor jealousy and envy is poison. Simply ask yourself the question “what do I
                        have to be grateful for” and you will begin to see the millions of blessings Allah has given
                        you. Things can always be worse</p>

                    <p><em>Change what you’re focusing on and you will feel a lot better. Don’t focus on what you lack
                            but what you’re given.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Whatever life throws at you, just accept it and say Alhamdullilah. It can’t be any other way
                            than the way it already is.</em></p>
