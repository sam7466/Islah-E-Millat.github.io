                        <h4>How does Islam represent women?<br>
                            What is the role of a women in Islam?<br>
                            Muslim women are oppressed. </h4>
                    </em>

                    <p>These are some of the few questions and statements that still lingers in the minds of the people.
                        Islam views women with equal rights just as men but the responsibilities and duties differ. When
                        a female is born into an Islamic family, she plays the role of a daughter to the members of the
                        family. It is said that <b>when a boy is born, then he brings one Noor (light) and when a girl
                            is born, then she brings two Noors”</b>. They are a blessing to the family. Females may not
                        have the must-earn rule to run the family but are the pathway to paradise. There is a narration
                        which states- <b>“One who loves his daughters and withstands the hardship of grooming and
                            getting them married, Almighty Allah makes Jannah (paradise) compulsory on him and keeps him
                            protects from the Fire of Jahannam (hell)”</b>. Wow, this narration explains how much
                        Almighty has made daughters valuable in Islam. The Almighty made it compulsory to be merciful
                        towards daughter. Paradise is a gift for every father who raises his daughters following the
                        protocols of Islam, provides and fulfils their needs and hand them over in marriage legally.
                        Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said, <b>“Whoever brings up two girls till they reach the age of puberty,
                            he and I will come on the Day of Resurrection like this (and he joined his index and middle
                            finger)”.</b>. Which father wouldn’t want that? The Prophet (peace be upon him) had 4
                        daughters and he loved them unconditionally. He never thought them as a burden but rather as a
                        package of blessings. He made a statement like, <b>“(My daughter) Fatima is a part of me, so
                            whoever angers her angers me.”</b> [Al Bukhari and Muslim]. It is depressing to know how
                        still people are unaware of the role of women as a daughter in Islam is and how sometimes
                        parents can look at them as a burden. Daughters are not a burden but a reward for the afterlife.
                    </p>

                    <p>Next, when a women’s wali becomes her husband with her permission, as Islam does not permit
                        forced marriage which is against the teaching of Islam, she becomes a wife. <b>“When a man gives
                            his daughter in marriage and she dislikes it, the marriage shall be not accepted”</b> [Sahih
                        Bukhari]. Now, when it comes to “wife in Islam” the impression embeds as staying at home
                        becoming a “slave”. That’s not the case. A wife in Islam is never to be taken for granted or put
                        down. Her wishes and goals can be granted and reached with her husband’s permission. She does
                        not have to give it up all because she is a “wife”. She is allowed to balance her goals and
                        duties without disappointing her spouse. She has to obey her husband but is allowed to voice her
                        opinions regarding any matters. A wife has to guard her and her husband’s honor. She is
                        entrusted with money and properties of her husband. When it comes to household, the
                        responsibilities in the chores has to be fairly shared and she is to do serve and run the house
                        as a favor not as an obligation. In English, she is called as “house wife” but in Arabic she is
                        known as “Rabbaitul Bait” or “The Queen of the House”. Woah, that for sure is a beautiful
                        impression. A wife is to be protected by her husband. Quran states <b>“Men are the protectors of
                            women, because Allah made some of them excel others and because they spend their wealth on
                            them….”</b> [4:34]. A wife in Islam helps her husband to obey the commands of Allah, be the
                        color to his world, share his burdens and help him face his ups and downs also respect his
                        family and do things that make him happy. And most of all respect him and be loyal and shower
                        each other with abundant love. Prophet (peace be upon him) narrated <b>“When they (a husband and
                            wife) hold hands, their sins will fall away from between their fingers.”</b> Allah said in
                        the Quran <b>“And we Created you in pairs”</b> [78:8]. This ayah explain that male and female
                        complete each other and be one with no boundaries and differences. One of the best hadith of
                        Prophet (peace be upon him) stated <b>“The woman who dies in the state of her husband being
                            pleased with her will enter Jannah (paradise).”</b></p>

                    <p>And, Family is the foundation and pillar of strength. As we are aware that father is the head of
                        the family the role of the mother is equally important. Islam has a higher level of respect
                        towards a “mother”. The mother has the greater responsibility and the greater reward in bringing
                        up her children accordingly. There is a saying “no love can be matched to a mother’s love”.
                        Quran states <b>Their mothers bore them in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their
                            ˹period of˺ bearing and weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their
                            prime at the age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your
                            favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please You. And
                            instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly repent to You, and I truly submit ˹to Your
                            Will˺.”</b> [46:15]. This ayah of the Quran explains us a great deal about the extents a
                        mother goes to bring her children to the world and build a generation with risks but it’s all
                        done with utmost love. Mothers are precious gifts to the world, they should be treated with love
                        and kindness and obeyed at all circumstances. The following narration of the Prophet (peace be
                        upon him) in an occasion states: <b>“God has forbidden for you to be undutiful to your
                            mothers”</b> [Sahih Bukhari]. Hence, when a women becomes a mother she is an even more
                        important figure in Islam. She is valued so much that Jannah lies under her feet. Prophet (peace
                        be upon him) said <b>“Paradise lies at the feet of your mother”</b> [Tirmidhi].</p>

                    <p>Therefore, Women are so privileged and honored in Islam that a whole chapter in the Holy Quran is
                        dedicated to them <b>[Surah An Nisa, Chapter 4]</b>. It is a blessing and pride to be born as
                        women in Islam. The first martyr in Islam was a woman – <b>Summaya</b> (peace be upon her). The
                        first who believed in Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a woman – <b>Khadeeja</b> (peace
                        be upon her). Women have their own rights to education, independence, marriage, dignity and
                        inheritance in Islam. A women carries the title of “<b>Muslimah</b>” with her all throughout her
                        life and is authorized with many rights and protected. It is always tobminded and remembered
                        “<b>Muslim Women are not oppressed</b>”. </p>
