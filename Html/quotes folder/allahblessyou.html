                    <p>If you spend a second complaining, you have wasted a second.
                    </p>

                    <p>It might feel good to complain but literally no progress is being made. It also shows that you’re
                        dissatisfied with Allah’s qadr (fate) he has ordained for you.</p>

                    <p>All of us in life will go through good times and bad, the one thing we must not do is complain.
                        There’s another saying that whatever you focus on will be true to you. </p>



                    <p>You can probably find a million ways you’ve been cheated and no one is denying that these things
                        didn’t happen. But what can you do today that’s going to change the past? It does you no justice
                        to feel bad or pity yourself. How about instead we learn from the past and thank Allah for the
                        lesson that can be learned from these experiences. It truly is a blessings of Allah, we just
                        need to see it as such.</p>

                    <p>If you instead switch the question around and ask all the ways He has blessed you, you’ll have a
                        million different reasons to praise Him. Learn to thank Allah from the smallest of things like
                        the lace on your shoe to bigger things like your health, wealth, and family.</p>

                    <p>Allah is not limited, he is the most gracious and most merciful. You can ask for all your heart
                        desires (as long as it’s permissible). What we need to mindful of is to desiring something and
                        invoking Allah but then having a fixed expectation of the outcome.</p>

                    <p>It’s the rigid expectation which taints the soul. If we make dua with the mindset that it will be
                        fulfilled and it is not, we can grow bitter and here shaytan plays his tricks in your mind by
                        saying things like “why does he not listen to me” or “why am I not deserving”. We balloon up
                        with negative emotions.</p>

                    <p>We should make dua and ask Allah to bless us with happiness, success and whatever is good. But if
                        the opposite of what we expect comes true we have to learn to say Alhamdulillah and accept our
                        fate. Surely Allah knows what’s best. To wish life to be any other way then it currently is, is
                        foolish. Until you learn to make a time machine to rewind the clock, there’s no point to dwell
                        on what could’ve been.’</p>

                    <p>After the section on how to recite Allah Bless you in Arabic. We’ve put together a long list of
                        “May Allah Bless You” quotes to inspire you to find the tiny things you can be appreciative of.
                        Hope you enjoy this quick read. If you do please share and spread knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>HOW DO YOU SAY MAY ALLAH BLESS YOU IN ARABIC</strong></p>

                    <p>It is better to recite Dua in Arabic if you know it, if you do not then it is permissible to ask
                        Allah in your native language. To say May Allah for you in Arabic it would be:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 60px;">بارك الله فيك</span></p>

                    <p>The transliteration for this is Baraka Allahu Fik, meaning May Allah Bless You.</p>

                    <p><strong>MAY ALLAH BLESS YOU DUA AND QUOTES</strong></p>

                    <p><span class="numbered-list" style=" color: black;">1.</span> Is He [not best] who responds to the
                        desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is
                        there a deity with Allah ? Little do you remember. (27:62)</p>

                    <p><span class="numbered-list" style=" color: black;">2.</span> He said, “I only complain of my
                        suffering and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you do not know. (12:86)</p>

                    <p><strong>FINAL NOTE:</strong></p>
                    <p>One day I was behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [riding on the same
                        mount] and he said, “O young man, I shall teach you some words [of advice]: Be mindful of Allah
                        and Allah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him in front of you. If you
                        ask, then ask Allah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allah [alone]. And know
                        that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit
                        you except with what Allah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together
                        to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allah had already prescribed
                        against you. (an excerpt from hadith #19 of the 40 Hadith of Al-Nawawi)</p>
