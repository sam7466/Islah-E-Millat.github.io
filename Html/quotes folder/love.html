                        No religion encourages showing affection, mutual love, and intimacy like Islam. Love in Islam is
                        all encompassing, it promotes healthy and halal relationship between men and women, towards
                        family, friends, and to your neighbor.
                    </p>

                    <p>Love in Islam can be categorized in a hierarchy with 3 distinct categories.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Love for Allah SWT</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Love for his Prophet (may peace be upon him).</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Love for others for the sake of Allah. This includes
                                your spouse, friends, family, and strangers.</span></li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>True love is based in spirituality whereas false love is based on short-term fulfillment. We’ve
                        all experienced extreme happiness when we were excited in purchasing something of intense
                        desire. However, as times passes us by, we become insensitive towards it, whatever it may have
                        been. This is false love. Attraction between men and women based on physical appearance, that is
                        also a short-term experience and false. </p>

                    <p>In this article, we’ll explore true love based on spirituality. We’ll cover many beautiful
                        Islamic quotes about love from Quran, Hadith, and from famous scholars and poets. By the end
                        you’ll have more knowledge on Islamic viewpoint on love, marriage, and towards life.</p>
