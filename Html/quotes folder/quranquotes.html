                        The Quran for Muslims is the perfect book.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was sent down by Allah, through his angel Jabreel, who revealed the 114 chapters over the
                        course of 23 years to Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him. It was his life’s mission to
                        deliver this message to mankind and help guide and save them.
                    </p>

                        <strong>What Makes the Quran Perfect?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Quran is free from any doubts as it’s sent by Allah himself, it teaches people to live a
                        balanced life (both socially and spiritually), been preserved and unchanged for centuries, it’s
                        also the only book that has been memorized cover to cover by thousands if not millions of people
                        since its revelation.</p>

                        Ayat 2</p>

                    <p>“….so whenever guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows my guidance, then there will
                        neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve.” Ayat 38</p>

                    <p>“And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].” Ayat 42</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">There are some jaw dropping quotes from the Quran that leave you in awe
                        the first time you read them, for me this was a powerful one. Through life experience I’ve
                        noticed countless times by observing others and myself that we do not like to admit or faults or
                        try to conceal our vices. I believe this is human nature, we unknowingly do this as a defense
                        mechanism to protect our ego. Sometimes we delude ourselves so much we begin to believe our own
                        lies. So, in a way, this ayat is telling us not too fool ourselves. I’ve found the best way to
                        avoid fooling ourselves is to simply try our best to do what is right, doesn’t matter who sees
                        it. Do the right thing for your own psyche and you will no longer have to “conceal with
                        falsehood” because the rest won’t matter, you did the right thing. Sometimes it helps to believe
                        your in a movie and everything is being recorded, and in a way it is, but on that day when you
                        get to rewind and play back the tape it will be too late. </p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/Q5.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>“Do not worship except Allah ; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy.
                        <b>And speak to people good [words]</b> and establish prayer and give zakah.” Then you turned
                        away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.” Surah Baqarah Ayat 83
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">We’ve all heard sayings like “If you have nothing good to say then
                        don’t say it” but we realize this is actually difficult in practice. We at some point in our
                        life say things we regret and wish we could take back. So, this quote from the Quran is just a
                        reminder that nothing good comes from screaming negativity. A useful tactic I’ve learned when
                        you’re angry or about to send a ‘passionate’ email with strong wording is to just wait one day.
                        If you feel the same way tomorrow morning then go ahead and press send but you’ll notice you
                        won’t be as emotionally invested in letting the other party know exactly how you feel. <b>After
                            all, it’s better to take the high road, it’s less crowded.</b></p>

                    <p>“So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.” Surah Baqarah
                        Verse 152</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">Nothing in this world can happen without the will of Allah. This is
                        similar to message from hadith in Sahih Muslim number 2675: “I am near to the thought of my
                        servant as he thinks about me, and I am with him as he remembers me. And if he remembers me in
                        his heart, I also remember him in my heart, and if he remembers me in assembly I remember him in
                        assembly, better than his (remembrance), and if he draws near me by the span of a palm, I draw
                        near him by the cubit, and if he draws near me by the cubit I draw near him by the space
                        (covered by) two hands. And if he walks towards me, I rush towards him.”</p>

                        relations]. They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them.” Ayat 187</p>
                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/Q9.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>“Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the
                        consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it
                        has earned. “Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and
                        lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us
                        not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy
                        upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people.” Ayat 286</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;"><b> Allah does not charge a soul except that which is within its
                            capacity.</b> How many struggles or adversities have you overcome in life thus far? Remember
                        the last thing you thought would destroy you or seemed insurmountable… but look here you are
                        still standing. We think in isolation and believe the most recent problem is the greatest but
                        the truth is all our troubles have been experienced by humanity before us. So when in the Quran
                        it mentions “lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us” we must
                        realize that these problems are not new, they have been handled and solved by those before us we
                        just have to be creative and search for the solutions instead of being anxious and afraid.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;"><b>United we stand, divided we fall.</b> This ayat is the same notion,
                        in order to be successful we need the help of other people. Question, how can we be united when
                        the message ingrained in us since we were children was ‘avoid talking to strangers’ or ‘stranger
                        danger’. This message does not serve us as adults and the reality is we should talk to
                        strangers. These are the people who make up our communities our masjids and can be a source of
                        support and help. </p>

                    <p>“Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your [full] compensation on the Day of
                        Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained [his
                        desire]. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion.” Ayat 185</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">This is a reminder of our mortality. If you passed away today would you
                        be satisfied with that which you had accomplished? Are you proud of the life and your legacy? If
                        not, I’ve got some good news…you are still alive. Tomorrow is a new day and you can change
                        directions. To reach a destination does take time, you can’t arrive at a 10 year destination
                        overnight, but to change directions you can do that today. You just have to decide, commit, and
                        be specific.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">For example, if you’re not happy about your weight tomorrow you can
                        begin your exercise regimen of doing 10 minutes of cardio everyday at 10am. Just make a promise
                        to yourself for one month to see it through. After day one you won’t see any results but after
                        day 14 you’ll see some results.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">So remember, you’re going to die but it doesn’t have to be in vain,
                        decide what is important and work towards it. You have the power to change directions overnight
                        and don’t have to repeat the next 5 years like the past five.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">Another Quran quote about death, it’s one I constantly think about.
                        Humans are the only life form aware of their mortality, it’s an inevitable truth we can’t
                        escape. This quote from the Quran is a reminder it doesn’t matter if you live in a villa or
                        palace death will find you. We often strive for wealth (and there’s nothing wrong with that
                        goal) but some fail at spending their entire life in the pursuit of money and won’t be able to
                        buy back time lost. </p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">The Quran recognizes how forgiving others can be difficult. I believe
                        it’s because we don’t live in the present moment, we constantly replay memories of the past and
                        dwell on it. Another reason is we don’t want to forgive is because we falsely believe that if we
                        open ourselves up again we’ll get the same outcome. Lastly, it’s easier to harbor anger when
                        someone wronged you then to seek tranquility. It’s only natural we lean into whichever we
                        believe to be easier. Just remember next time you get angry or upset, holding onto that feeling
                        is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.</p>

                        But if they give by measure or by weight to them, they cause loss. Do they not think that they
                        will be resurrected” Ayat 1-4</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">This is beautiful lesson about Economics and Business success from the
                        Quran. Business’ that thrive are one’s that create more value for consumers than they take. This
                        simple concept is often neglected by individuals that start business’ because they primarily get
                        into business for selfish reasons, they want money and the freedom. Profits and freedom are a by
                        product that comes only to those who provide tremendous value upfront for their users. Failure
                        to understand this is a major contributor to the statistic that 80% of business fail within the
                        first 5 years. It’s a difficult task to bring the most value to the marketplace while remaining
                        cost effective and competitive.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 15px 50px;">More generally speaking, it’s just a good long term strategy to bring
                        more to the table than you get paid for. It’s an investment in yourself and for your future by
                        becoming an attractive person. Overtime time you will be recognized for your work and inshallah
                        given more opportunities. As this verse from Quran says, “woe to those who give less [and]…take
                        in full”. Do not get caught in the take, take, take, gimme, gimme, gimme short-term attitude
                        that many folks do. </p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">“We have certainly created man into hardship. Does he think that never
                        will anyone overcome him?” Surah Balad Ayat 4-5</p>
                    <p>The Buddhist have a saying that life is suffering, this Quran verse shares the similar sentiment
                        that life is hard. The surah continues and it reads, “And have shown him the two ways?” which is
                        the paradox of choice. You would suspect that more choices would lead to more freedom and
                        happiness but it really just does the opposite. We are constantly having inner battles between
                        right or wrong, we are dissatisfied with the choices we make (did I pick the right thing? I
                        should’ve just went with the first option) and this causes uneasiness. Sometimes we’re better
                        off with limited choice. Sometimes being told the reality helps us to understand what is
                        required, so yes it’s suppose to be hard, if the choices were easy then everyone would be among
                        the righteous. </p>
                    <p>“And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one
                        another to compassion.” Ayat 17</p>

                    <p>Surah Ash Shams doesn’t have a singular quote that can be pulled as each ayat is part of a
                        greater message. In this Surah it talks about the She-Camel of Prophet Salih. The people of
                        Thamud had “hamstrung” the camel which directly went against the warnings of Allah (SWT) and
                        they suffered the conseuqence. </p>

                    <p style="margin: 0px 50px;">Islam places emphasis not just on the doing but the intent behind the
                        action. It says pray but do not be heedless in prayer, to be charitable but not for the pursuit
                        of notoriety, and as this Quran verse says, to give and but do not expect something in return.

                    <p>Surah Al-Fil does not have single quote which can be pulled as it will be out of context. This
                        chapter of the Quran tells the story of the companions of the elephant. Abraha (an Aksumite army
                        general) began a military expedition against the Quraysh of Mecca. He attacked Meccans while
                        riding on an elephant. It is said Allah saved the Meccans from this force by sending a swarm of
                        birds that pelted the invaders with clay stones and destroyed them. The entire army of Abraha
                        was destroyed for attacking the Kaabah.</p>

                    <p>In Surah Quryash, Allah sent down a message for security to the Meccan tribe Quryash. The message
                        is still applicable today. Ilaf is a direct Quranic name for boys and girls that means “oath”,
                        “promise”, “safety”, “security”.</p>

                    <p>Surah Masad is a very short Surah, there’s no single quote that can be pulled as the Surah tells
                        the story of Prophet Muhammad Paternal Uncle Abu Lahab and his wife. In this Surah it curses
                        both his uncle and his wife for staunchly opposing Islam. In the Surah it mentions the wife as
                        the ‘bearer of the wood’ and according to Tafsir by Ibn Kathir this is because she is said to
                        have carried thorns and would cast them in Muhammad’s pathway as to injure his feet.</p>
