                <div class="my-text">

                    <p>If we scan the human history, the one and only complete and matchless personality is Prophet
                        Muhammad (PBUH). Not only in one shade of life but in all spheres of life. There are two
                        enormous fields of life – one is <b>spiritual, religious and moral</b> – other is <b>social,
                            political, cultural and practical</b>. If any personality performed and embedded
                        overwhelmingly, tremendously, elegantly and matchlessly in both the fields, that is the
                        personality of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>

                    <p>He (PBUH) is the only one who has enriched this garden of world with roses of words, with deeply
                        immersed character of ethics, with soul stirring personality of morals, with integrated colors
                        of relations, with fragrance of forgiveness, with glory of patience, with sublime acts of
                        sacrifice. He (PBUH) is supreme and incomparable in every walk of life either as a leader of the
                        state or a preacher or a teacher or a friend or a neighbor. His character as husband is with
                        outmost love and as a father with full of compassion. As an educator and a guide, he is
                        unrivalled. As a brave warrior and victorious leader, he is inimitable. He (PBUH) is foremost
                        example in all aspects of life and all his glorious actions and merits are performed in purely
                        natural human way not in a way of extraordinary feasts and miracles.</p>

                    <p>He (PBUH) is unparalleled and unprecedented on the page of globe because any great personality of
                        past consists many fabricated accounts but Prophet Mohammed’s life from childhood till now is
                        proven and recorded. There are no myths and fables to his life history. Allah says in the Holy
                        Quran: <em style="background: #FFECB9;
                        font-size: 17px;">“Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever
                            has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often”</em>. (33:21)</p>

                    <p>In every aspects of life till the day of judgment, he (PBUH) is a role model. I will present some
                        examples of his dealings, feelings, emotions, political vision, glorious sense of congruency and
                        of astute observation. There are two moments of human life which demonstrates what actually a
                        person is – <b>gains and pains</b>. If one remains stable, steadfast, and symmetric in pains, it
                        means he has the highest essence of humanity and in pains if any personality has glittering and
                        remarkable character, that is Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). To quell the melodious fountain of
                        preaching, the enemies have adopted all the means – baleful, cruel, abusive, violent, expulsive,
                        hostile, oppressive and persecuted ways to slack his ardent reforming zeal. They tried to
                        distort Prophet’s message while ridiculing. They tried to defame Prophet as calling him a poet,
                        a story teller, a liar, a madman, pressuring his uncle, threatening with armed conflict, false
                        accusations, slandering, demanding from Prophet superhuman attributes, offering enticement, with
                        intimidation, physical torture, general boycott, attempt to murder. They practiced all tactics
                        but nothing could eclipse the glittering moon!</p>

                    <p>Prophet (PBUH)’s two daughters Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum (RA) were divorced. The Quraysh held a
                        meeting to outcast and complete social boycott of Banu Hashim and Banu alMuttalib. They agreed
                        that no clans would marry their daughters, no business deal, no meeting or company with them, no
                        trade, no help and once they all agreed, they put this agreement in writing. They were forced to
                        leave Makah. This social boycott was so devastating and rigorous that they had to eat leaves of
                        trees. The cries of children and women with pangs of hunger could be heard in whole valley. This
                        boycott lasted around 3 years. The message of Prophet (PBUH) was repugnant to the haughty
                        Quraish and they fueled their anger and spared no opportunity to demonize him. Uqba strangled
                        the Prophet (PBUH) from behind, Abu Jahil ordered camel intestines to be dumped over Prophet
                        (PBUH), Utayba spat in front of the Prophet (PBUH), a woman used to throw garbage. In Taif,
                        enemies set the young boys and slaves to abuse and throw stones at Prophet (PBUH). Samya (RA)
                        was martyred when a non-muslim shoved a spear in her private parts. Yasser (RA) was martyred
                        when enemies of Islam tied him to two horses and ripped his body apart. Bilal was tortured,
                        whipped and made to lay on scorching sand. Khabab (RA) was forced to lie on burning coals and
                        smell his own flesh cooking. Despite of all their abuse, boycott, expulsion, threats, cruelty,
                        torture and smear campaign, Prophet(PBUH) never budged an inch away from his mission and he
                        (PBUH) with his inexhaustible courage and infinite patience said: <em style="background: #FFECB9;
                        font-size: 17px;">“if they place the sun on my right hand and the moon on my left hand in
                            return forgiving up my mission, I will never desist until either makes it triumph or I
                            perish defending it”</em>. So this firmness, courage, steadfastness in a gracious and
                        magnanimous way is matchless in the human history!</p>

                    <p>The other essence of human life is how a person deals with his worst enemies when they are under
                        his captivity and specially those enemies who have tortured, intended to murder, enforced to
                        exile, compelled to starve, divorcing daughters, pulling a daughter from camel leading to
                        wounds, brutal killing of companions and so on. But history could not find such a glowing and
                        tremendous person like Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) who dealt his arch enemies as cherished guests.
                        When prisoners of Badr were taken to Medina, Prophet Muhamad (PBUH) instructed the Muslims to
                        treat the prisoners well and mercifully. The prisoners were treated in such a ways as captors
                        offered best meal to the captives and kept dates for themselves. The uncle of Prophet (PBUH)
                        Abbas was tightened hardly and when Prophet (PBUH) heard him groaning, he could not sleep and
                        Omar (RA) came to know about agitation of Prophet (PBUH), he untied Abbas. When the Prophet
                        (PBUH) consulted with Abu Baker (RA) and Omar (RA) on what to do with the prisoners, Omar (RA)
                        suggested to kill them and Abu Baker (RA) suggested to free them while charging ransom. The most
                        kind-hearted Prophet liked Abu baker’s suggestion. The amount of ransom was from 4000 dirhams to
                        10000 dirhams as per captives’ financial condition.</p>

                    <p>Another form of ransom was adopted that was remarkable and distinguished in history of war
                        prisoners. That was if any prisoner cannot afford ransom amount, he can teach 10 children the
                        art of reading and writing for the sake of his freedom. In prisoners there was an eloquent
                        orator – Sohail bin Amr. Omar (RA) wished to drew out his front teeth to make him unmelodic
                        because he was considered a brilliant speaker and poet against Islam, but Prophet of mercy
                        (PBUH) stopped Omar (RA). Sohail bin Amr requested to Prophet telling he has five daughters and
                        he cannot pay the ransom amount. The prophet of mercy released Sohail without ransom money.
                        Abdullah bin Rawah (RA) suggested to throw prisoners into burning fire but Prophet of mercy
                        neglected his suggestion.</p>

                    <p>Another magnificent victory was the conquest of Makkah. It was prelude to new era. This was city
                        from where Prophet (PBUH) was exiled forcefully with heavy heart but when he regained and
                        entered in Makkah as a conqueror. While seated on his camel, the Prophet bent low in humility
                        that his forehead almost touched the saddle. It was announced that today is the day of mercy, he
                        who ever entered Abu Sufiyan house will be safe, and who ever closed his own house door is also
                        safe, and whoever would go in Sacred Mosque is also safe. There is no example of such a clemency
                        in human history, after observing boundless sea of mercy both men and women flocked to Prophet
                        (PBUH) to pay homage and to accept Islam. This was the moment of glory in the history of human
                        beings. Bilal who was descended under feet and was brutally beaten in same city, now was
                        ascending on the roof of Ka’aba. This conquest of Makkah celebrated as a Day of Mercy is a
                        matchless example of mercy in human history.</p>

                    <p>One of the biggest and the greatest quality which makes Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) matchless is what
                        he preached and practiced. He is a role model in all rainbows of human aspects. He is the best
                        reformer, the best leader, the best soldier, the best worshipper, the best father, the best
                        husband, the best friend, the best teacher, the best preacher and the best human being. The best
                        morals which makes a man immoral are found in Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) matchlessly – his strong
                        faith, sound intellect and knowledge, sincerity, cleanliness, beauty, worship, self-disciplined,
                        simplicity, enjoining good and forbidding evil, resolving disputes, polite and courteous, speech
                        brief and beneficial, forbearance, altruism, kindness and compassion, sharing work,
                        truthfulness, moderate, smiling face, honesty and reliability, bravery and courage, humbleness,
                        justice and fairness, contentment, forgiveness, generosity and many more! In human history, all
                        teachers and preachers with their outmost effort were able to change some portion of society but
                        matchless feature of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is that he changed both exterior and interior
                        collectively that all aspects of human society – social, political and moral – were merged in a
                        new and novel way. The upright performance was emanated from market to mosque, from schools to
                        houses, from tribal disputes to courts, from nears and dears to warfare, from feeling to
                        dealings, from emotions to relations, from customs to traditions, from thoughts to habits, from
                        sense of rights to performance of duties, measures of good and bad, standards of right and
                        wrong, sense of moral values, concept of bravery and slavery, a sense of peace and war, rules of
                        trade and economy, sense of pride, respect of women, the rules of marriages, daughters were not
                        being slaughtered. The universe has witnessed once and only such a great and matchless
                        personality who gifted the world with new peaceful and respectful era.</p>

                    <p>He is matchless and unique from the best of the best as narrated by Al-Abbas, that Prophet (PBUH)
                        said: <em style="background: #FFECB9;
                        font-size: 17px;">“I am Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib, indeed Allah created the
                            creation, and He put me in the best [group] of them, then He made them into two groups, so
                            He put me in the best group of them, then He made them into tribes, so He put me in the best
                            of them in tribe, then He made them into houses, so He put me in the best of them in tribe
                            and lineage”</em>. The best of mankind with the best teachings, preaching, actions and
                        performance. The matchless features that grown the garden of world with new roses and fragrance.
                        These features are matchless like a matchless personality, unity of ideology and practice,
                        firmness and consistency, compatibility of aim and action, logical sequence of events and his
                        strategy, prioritizing the collective and national interest, empirical and practical steps,
                        consistent continuity of struggle, humanitarian foundation of state, combination of Divine will
                        and and Holy Prophet’s vision, the best use of available resources, preparation of personal and
                        work force, the best optimistic approach, stayed hopeful and never gave in. So the result of all
                        this struggle and endeavor was so endearing and superb that universe has never seen such a great
                        personality before or after.</p>

                    <p>All this struggle resulted in a new world order, new change that merged on the map of the world
                        was, restoration of human dignity, exaltedness of woman, boundless respect of mother,
                        jollification on daughter’s birth, eradication of social evils, kind treatment with the whole
                        world, change of mind and thoughts, repaying of evil with good, balance of justice, the bases of
                        testimony, women rights in heritage, considering the moral values in contracts, abolishing the
                        seeds of enmity, elimination of prejudice, rights of relatives and neighbors, restoration of the
                        value of human life, establishing a judicial system, to purify economy from interest, to earn
                        livelihood from legal means, distinction between legal and illegal, changing short sightedness
                        into broad vision, stress on mercy in warfare, kind treatment with parents, gentle and merciful
                        behavior towards prisoners, changing the rules of ransom, education of tolerance and
                        forgiveness, quashing the hatred weeds, the teachings of human unity, the blessing of
                        monotheism, an end of despondency and suspicion, encouragement to repent, change in standards of
                        beauty, exponents of human equality, merciful instruction while slaughtering an animal, sympathy
                        with the feeble and the week, kind treatment with maids and servants, to pay the wages to labors
                        before their sweat has dried up, good treatment with concubines, taking care of the old ones and
                        children, well serving of the guests and so on. After this revolution the world became so
                        beautiful that even paradise seems to be envying.</p>
