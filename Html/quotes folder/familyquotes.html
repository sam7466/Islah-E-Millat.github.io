                    <p>
                        Something strange seems to be happening in our generation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Divorce rate is the highest it’s ever been at 40 to 50%, the rate of divorce of subsequent
                        marriages is even higher. It seems the importance placed on family and maintaining family ties
                        is disintegrating.
                    </p>
                    <p>The culture is shifting focus towards individualism and the media seems biased in broadcasting
                        individuals with more selfish pursuits.</p>

                    <p>
                        This is not the way of Islam. A healthy functioning society, and on a micro level, a person’s
                        happiness is created from a sense of belonging and closeness to one another. And the truth is
                        the family unit is the basic element from which it all begins.
                    </p>

                    <p>The family offers security, tranquility, and support. It creates social order and gives life
                        purpose and meaning which is why Islam is adamant on protecting the family from externalities
                        that wish to disrupt it.</p>

                    <p>Now, the best place to turn and find answers to many problems we encounter is in the Qur’an and
                        the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (saws). We will learn how every role of the family is important –
                        from parents to children to spouses and kin. </p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center; color: dodgerblue;"><strong>HADITH ON FAMILY IN ISLAM</strong></h2>



                    <p>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (May be upon him) said:
                    </p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/F1.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>The father is the shepherd over his family, he is responsible to them, he must provide, protect,
                        and care for them to the best of his abilities. The mother is like the shepherd over the house,
                        it is her role to guard the house and her children. She is responsible for nurturing a happy
                        environment where little ones can grow and learn and play.</p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/F2.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>Abu Huraira (May Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Messenger (pbuh) as saying: When a
                        man dies, his acts come to an end, but three, recurring charity, or knowledge (by which people)
                        benefit, or a pious son, who prays for him (for the deceased). Sahih Muslim Book 13, Hadith 4005
                    </p>

                    <p>It is the responsibility of the parents to teach and educate the message of Islam to children at
                        an early age otherwise they will grow up heedless. They will not know any better and you cannot
                        expect them in their older age to pray for you, look after you, and spread Islam to their kids.
                        On the other hand, if you raise your kids with the right values you can expect eternal sadaqah
                        jariyah. Ultimately, you will reap what you sow, if you sow well you will reap well.</p>

                    <p>Abu Huraira reported that a person said: Allah’s Messenger, who amongst the people is most
                        deserving of my good treatment? He said: Your mother, again your mother, again your mother, then
                        your father, then your nearest relatives according to the order (of nearness). Sahih Muslim Book
                        32, Hadith 6181</p>

                    <p>It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that: the Prophet said: “The best of you is the one who is best
                        to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” Ibn Majah Book 9, Hadith 1977</p>

                    <p>Abu Mas’ud Al-Ansari narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: “A man’s spending on his family
                        is charity.” (Jami At Tirmidhi Book 1, Hadith 1965)</p>

                    <p>It was narrated that ‘Aishah said: “The Prophet raced with me and I beat him.” Grade: Sahih
                        (Darussalam) English reference: Vol. 3, Book 9, Hadith 1979</p>

                    <p>This hadith shows what a healthy relationship looks like, for men we need to sometimes let our
                        wives win. As a wife, sometimes let your husband win. This hadith teaches us to encourage each
                        other, support each other, lift each other up. </p>

                    <p>It was narrated from ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr that: the Messenger of Allah said: “The best of you are
                        those who are best to their womenfolk.” Grade : Sahih (Darussalam) (English reference : Vol. 3,
                        Book 9, Hadith 1978)</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center; color: dodgerblue;"><strong>QURAN QUOTES ABOUT FAMILY</strong></h2>
                    <p>The Quran advises us on the values and character we should strive towards. If we truly believe in
                        these values our natural behavior and actions will unconsciously reflect it. These Quranic
                        verses mentions husband, wives, respect towards parents, and the importance of home.</p>
                    <p><strong>QURAN QUOTES FOR COUPLES:</strong></p>
                    <p>“…They (your wives, O men) are a garment for you and you (men) are a garment for them…” (Quran
                        2:187)</p>
                    <p>Those who spend [charity] in prosperity and in adversity, who repress anger, and who forgive men;
                        verily, God loves the good doers. (3:134)</p>
                    <p>It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in
                        security with her. And when he covers her, she carries a light burden and continues therein. And
                        when it becomes heavy, they both invoke Allah, their Lord, “If You should give us a good
                        [child], we will surely be among the grateful.” (7:189)</p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/F3.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity
                        in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people
                        who give thought. (30:21)</p>
                    <p>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him
                        (Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women and
                        fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the
                        wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you. (Muhsin Khan Translation 4:1)
                    </p>
                    <p>And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he
                        suppresses grief. He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been
                        informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground? Unquestionably, evil is
                        what they decide. For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is the description of evil; and
                        for Allah is the highest attribute. And He is Exalted in Might, the Wise. (Surah An-Nahl 58-60)
                    </p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/F4.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>In Prophet Muhammad last sermon, he said “O People, it is true that you have certain rights with
                        regard to your women, but they also have right over you. If they abide by your right then to
                        them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind
                        to them for they are your partners and committed helpers.”</p>
                    <p>And those who say, “Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and
                        make us an example for the righteous.” Those will be awarded the Chamber for what they patiently
                        endured, and they will be received therein with greetings and [words of] peace. (25:74-75)</p>

                    <p><strong>BE GOOD TO PARENTS, RELATIVES AND TO YOUR CHILDREN:</strong></p>

                    <p>And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment. His mother carried him with
                        hardship and gave birth to him with hardship, and his gestation and weaning [period] is thirty
                        months. [He grows] until, when he reaches maturity and reaches [the age of] forty years, he
                        says, “My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon
                        my parents and to work righteousness of which You will approve and make righteous for me my
                        offspring. Indeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims.” (46:15)</p>
                    <p>And those who believed and whose descendants followed them in faith – We will join with them
                        their descendants, and We will not deprive them of anything of their deeds. Every person, for
                        what he earned, is retained. And We will provide them with fruit and meat from whatever they
                        desire. (52:21-22)</p>
                    <p>Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and
                        bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded. (16:90)</p>
                    <p>And Allah has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the
                        animals tents which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment; and from
                        their wool, fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a time. (16:80)</p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/F5.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment.
                        Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], “uff,”
                        and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word. And lower to them the wing of humility out
                        of mercy and say, “My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small.”
                        (17:23)</p>
                    <p>And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], “Do
                        not worship except Allah ; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And
                        speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah.” Then you turned away, except
                        a few of you, and you were refusing. (2:83)</p>
                    <p>Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives, orphans,
                        the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side, the
                        traveler, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like those who are
                        self-deluding and boastful. (4:36)</p>

                    <p><strong>GUARD YOUR HOME:</strong></p>
                    <p>And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times
                        of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah
                        intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet’s] household,
                        and to purify you with [extensive] purification. (33:33)</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center; color: dodgerblue;"><strong>MAINTAINING FAMILY TIES</strong></h2>
                    <p>Family ties mean that no matter how much you might want to run from your family, you can’t.
                        Here’s some quotes about the importance of maintaining family ties and the rewards of doing so.
                    </p>

                    <p class="centerImg">
                        <img src="/bg/F6.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>The person who perfectly maintains the ties of kinship is not the one who does it because he gets
                        recompensed by his relatives (for being kind and good to them), but the one who truly maintains
                        the bonds of kinship is the one who persists in doing so even though the latter has severed the
                        ties of kinship with him. [Al-Bukhari].</p>

                    <p><b>Strength comes in numbers</b>. Sayings like this can become trite, but that doesn’t make them
                        less true. How can we have a strong united Ummah when no one makes the effort to maintain ties
                        with family. Yes, life does get busy but that doesn’t excuse checking in from time to time just
                        to see how somebody is doing. I am guilty of this myself, but just being thoughtful to reach out
                        can go a long way. Take the initiative and don’t expect anything in return. Take pride in being
                        the one who makes the effort.</p>
                    <p>Jubair bin Mut’am (RAA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The one who severs the
                        ties of kinship will not enter Paradise.” Agreed upon. Bulugh al-Maram English reference : Book
                        16, Hadith 1498</p>
                    <p>So would you perhaps, if you turned away, cause corruption on earth and sever your [ties of]
                        relationship? (47:22)</p>
                    <p>Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings upon him) said, “The bond of relationship is suspending
                        from the Throne, and says: ‘He who keeps good relations with me, Allah will keep connection with
                        him, but whosoever severs relations with me, Allah will sever connection with him.” [Al-Bukhari
                        and Muslim]</p>
