                    <p>What is tawwakul?</p>
                    <p>Tawakkul is an Arabic word for the Islamic concept of putting full reliance and trust in Allah’s
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>The Quran speaks about this, success is for the believer who obeys God’s commandments.
                        It’s easy for a Muslim to be faithful when things are going well, the true test is placed when
                        Allah has challenged a person in his or her life, will they keep their faith in God or turn
                        their backs? When things don’t go our way it’s easy to turn bitter or jealous and start making
                        looking over our shoulder to see what our neighbor has got. This has become especially toxic in
                        today’s times with the entire world being braggadocious on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
                    <p>We must guard our minds and what we take in much more carefully as it is having an effect on how
                        we perceive things. It distorts our perception of reality.</p>
                    <p>Now, a word of caution, some people take a tawwakul to mean they won’t strive to be the best
                        versions of themselves. For example, the amount of money you make in life is ‘pre-destined’
                        according to some of my Muslim friends so they use it as a crutch to play video games and as an
                        excuse to not try and better themselves by reading books and learning. To me this is the wrong
                        interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Tawwakul means to accept your fate, the good and the bad. My interpreation is you should try to
                        start your own business but don’t become attached to whether it succeeds or fails as this can
                        set up the wrong expectations. The outcome or result that is not up to you to decide. What you
                        must do is put forth the best possible effort, keep a positive attitude, to be happy and content
                        with what Allah has given you the opportunity for. If it works, “alhamdulillah”, if it doesn’t
                        “alhamdulillah”.

                    </p>
                    <p>The following are Tawakkul quotes to provide inspiration and motivation to keep your trust in
                        Allah.

                        <p><strong>Hadith on reliance:</strong></p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">Anas ibn Malik reported:</p>
                        <p>A man said, “O Messenger of Allah, should I tie my camel and trust in Allah, or should I
                            leave her untied and trust in Allah?” The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said,
                            “Tie her and trust in Allah.”</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">Grade: Hasan (Darussalam) <br>
                            Jami At-Tirmidhi English: Vol. 4, Book 11, Hadith 2517 <br>
                            Arabic reference: Book 37, Hadith 2707</p>

                    <p><strong>TRUST IN ALLAH QUOTES:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Said two men from those who feared [to disobey] upon whom Allah had bestowed favor, “Enter
                            upon them through the gate, for when you have entered it, you will be predominant. And upon
                            Allah rely, if you should be believers.” <span class="dodgerblue"> Surah Maidah Ayat 23</span></li>
                        <li>When you trust Allah in any decision then you don’t give it a second thought.</li>
                        <li>Allah becomes sufficient for you the very moment you put your entire trust in him.</li>
                        <li>Wa tawakkal ‘alal laah; wa kafaa billaahi Wakeelaa.<br>And rely upon Allah; and sufficient
                            is Allah as Disposer of affairs.<br><span class="dodgerblue">Surah Ahazab Ayat 3</span>.</li>
                        <li>And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly
                            submissive [to Allah]. <span class="dodgerblue">Surah Baqarah Ayah 45</span>.</li>
                        <li>Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: “If you
                            all depend on Allah with due reliance, He would certainly give you provision as He gives it
                            to birds who go forth hungry in the morning and return with full belly at dusk”.
                            [At-Tirmidhi].</li>
                        <li><span>A relationship with Allah is the most important relationship you can have. Trust him
                                and everything will always turn out fine.</span></li>
                        <li>My success depends on the quality (in terms of relevance, wisdom, propriety, tactics,
                            strategy and sincerity) and quantity I put in, not on the material results they appear to
                            produce, regardless of what kind of good or bad circumstances I happen to encounter.</li>
                        <li>“If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is
                            there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely.”
                            (<span class="dodgerblue">3:160</span>)</li>
                        <li>“Do not lose hope, nor be sad. You will surely be victorious if you are true in Faith.” And
                            do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].”
                            (<span class="dodgerblue">3:129</span>)</li>
                        <li>Have complete trust in Allah and have a strong action bias.</li>
                        <li>Your prayers will be answered. Be patient and trust the timing of Allah.</li>
                        <li>Trust your lord solely, people usually have double faces.</li>
                        <li>Tawakkal is that precious quality which brings peace of mind in this world and entrance in
                            Jannah without the judgement in the hereafter.</li>
                        <li><span>And rely upon the Ever-Living who does not die, and exalt [ Allah ] with His praise.
                                And sufficient is He to be, with the sins of His servants, Acquainted
                                (<span class="dodgerblue">25:58</span>).</span></li>
                        <li><span>[He is] the Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him
                                as Disposer of [your] affairs (<span class="dodgerblue">73:9</span>).</span></li>
                        <li><span>If you trust in Allah then nothing is impossible for you.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Allah has put me in this world temporarily for a test and all of my good and bad
                                circumstances are part of the test.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The real success is attaining the pleasure of Allah, not the results in this world.
                                Whether my efforts bear any visible result in this world or not, I must continue on my
                                course steadfastly.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Take a deep breath and let it go. Put your trust in Allah and let him guide
                                you.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Don’t drag the past with you. Let it be a school to teach you but don’t beat yourself
                                up over what happened. Similarly, don’t drag the future towards, let it unfold as it
                                will. Stay happy with what you have, enjoy the moment and love the process.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Our hearts get purified when We put trust in Allah.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Allah knows best what is best for us and at what time so We believers should rely upon
                                Allah and by having patience. indeed Allah’s plans are best.</span></li>
                        <li><span>“What is the extent of ‘tawakkul’? Imam Ali ibne Musa al-Ridha (a.s.): That you do not
                                fear anyone once you have relied on Allah!”</span></li>
                        <li><span>It is You (alone) we worship, and You (alone) we ask for help.</span></li>
                        <li><span>“Tawakkul is having complete trust that Allah’s plan is the best plan.” Yasmin
                                Mogahed</span></li>
                        <li><span>“Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, ‘Be!’ and
                                it is!” Surah Yasin Ayat 82</span></li>
                        <li><span>Do you realize how powerful trust in God is? Nothing can overpower you when you have
                                unshakeable trust in Him.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Just because you haven’t seen your Dua come true, doesn’t mean it hasn’t been heard.
                                Allah is all-hearing. Be patient.&nbsp;</span></li>

                            surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us. And upon Allah let those who
                            would rely [indeed] rely.” (<span class="dodgerblue">14:12</span>)</li>
