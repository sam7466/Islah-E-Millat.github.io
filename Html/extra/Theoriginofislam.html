                <h1>THE ORIGINS OF ISLAM</h1>
                <p>But where does the message of Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, fit in with
                    the previous messages revealed by God? A brief history of the prophets might clear this point.</p>
                <p>The first human, Adam, followed Islam, in that he directed worship to God alone and none else and
                    abided by His commandments. But through the passage of time and the dispersal of humanity throughout
                    the earth, people strayed from this message and began directing worship to others instead of or
                    along with God. Some took to worshipping the pious who passed away amongst them, while others took
                    to worshipping spirits and forces of nature. It was then that God started to send messengers to
                    humanity steering them back to the worship of God Alone, which accorded to their true nature, and
                    warning them of the grave consequences of directing any type of worship to others besides Him.</p>
                <p>The first of these messengers was Noah, who was sent to preach this message of Islam to his people,
                    after they had started to direct worship to their pious forefathers along with God. Noah called his
                    people to leave the worship of their idols, and ordered them to return to the worship of God Alone.
                    Some of them followed the teachings of Noah, while the majority disbelieved in him. Those who
                    followed Noah were followers of Islam, or Muslims, while those that did not, remained in their
                    disbelief and were seized with a punishment for doing so.</p>
                <p>After Noah, God sent messengers to every nation who had strayed from the Truth, to steer them back to
                    it. This Truth was the same throughout time: to reject all objects of worship and to direct all
                    worship without exception to God and none else, the Creator and Lord of all, and to abide by His
                    commandments. But as we mentioned before, because each nation differed in regards to their way of
                    life, language, and culture, specific messengers were sent to specific nations for a specific time
                    period.</p>
                <p>God sent messengers to all nations, and to the Kingdom of Babylon He sent Abraham – one of the
                    earliest and greatest prophets – who called his people to reject the worship of the idols to which
                    they were devoted. He called them to Islam, but they rejected him and even tried to kill him. God
                    put Abraham through many tests, and he proved true to all of them. For his many sacrifices, God
                    proclaimed that he would raise from amongst his progeny a great nation and choose prophets from
                    amongst them. Whenever people from his progeny started to stray away from the Truth, which was to
                    worship none but God alone and to obey His commandments, God sent them another messenger steering
                    them back to it.</p>
                <p>Consequently, we see that many prophets were sent amongst the progeny of Abraham, such as his two
                    sons Isaac and Ishmael, along with Jacob (Israel), Joseph, David, Solomon, Moses, and of course,
                    Jesus, to mention a few, may the peace and blessings of God be upon them all. Each prophet was sent
                    to the Children of Israel (the Jews) when they went astray from the true religion of God, and it
                    became obligatory upon them to follow the messenger which was sent to them and obey their
                    commandments. All of the messengers came with the same message, to reject worship of all other
                    beings except God Alone and to obey His commandments. Some disbelieved in the prophets, while others
                    believed. Those that believed were followers of Islam, or Muslims.</p>
                <p>From amongst the messengers was Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, from the
                    progeny of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, who was sent
                    as a messenger in succession to Jesus. Muhammad preached the same message of Islam as the previous
                    prophets and messengers – to direct all worship to God Alone and none else and to obey His
                    commandments – in which the followers of the previous prophets went astray.</p>
                <p>So as we see, the Prophet Muhammad was not the founder of a new religion, as many people mistakenly
                    think, but he was sent as the Final Prophet of Islam. By revealing His final message to Muhammad,
                    which is an eternal and universal message for all of mankind, God finally fulfilled the covenant
                    that He made with Abraham.</p>
                <p>Just as it was incumbent upon the those who were alive to follow the message of the last of the
                    succession of prophets which was sent to them, it becomes incumbent upon all of humanity to follow
                    the message of Muhammad. God promised that this message would remain unchanged and fit for all times
                    and places. Suffice is it to say that the way of Islam is the same as the way of the prophet
                    Abraham, because both the Bible and the Quran portray Abraham as a towering example of someone who
                    submitted himself completely to God and directed worship to Him alone and none else, and without any
                    intermediaries. Once this is realized, it should be clear that Islam has the most continuous and
                    universal message of any religion, because all prophets and messengers were “Muslims”, i.e. those
                    who submitted to God’s will, and they preached “Islam”, i.e. submission to the will of Almighty God
                    by worshipping Him Alone and obeying His commandments.</p>
                <p>So we see that those who call themselves Muslims today do not follow a new religion; rather they
                    follow the religion and message of all prophets and messengers which were sent to humanity by God’s
                    command, also known as Islam. The word “Islam” is an Arabic word which literally means “submission
                    to God”, and Muslims are those who willfully submit to and actively obey God, living in accordance
                    with His message.</p>
