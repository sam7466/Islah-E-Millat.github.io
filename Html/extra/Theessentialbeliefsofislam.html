                <h1>THE ESSENTIAL BELIEFS OF ISLAM</h1>
                <p>There are many aspects of belief in which one who adheres to Islam must have firm conviction. From
                    those aspects, the most important are six, known as the “Six Articles of Belief”.</p>
                <h2>1) Belief in god</h2>
                <p>Islam upholds strict monotheism and belief in God forms the heart of their faith. Islam teaches
                    belief in one God who neither gives birth nor was born Himself, and has no share in His caretaking
                    of the world. He alone gives life, causes death, brings good, causes affliction, and provides
                    sustenance for His creation. God in Islam is the sole Creator, Lord, Sustainer, Ruler, Judge, and
                    Savior of the universe. He has no equal in His qualities and abilities, such as knowledge and power.
                    All worship, veneration and homage is to be directed to God and none else. Any breach of these
                    concepts negates the basis of Islam.</p>
                <h2>2) Belief in the Angels</h2>
                <p>Adherents to Islam must believe in the Unseen world as mentioned in the Quran. From this world are
                    the angels’ emissaries of God, each assigned with a specific task. They have no free-will or ability
                    to disobey; it is their very nature to be God's faithful servants. Angels are not to be taken as
                    demigods or objects of praise or veneration; they are mere servants of God obeying His every
                    command.</p>
                <h2>3) Belief in the Prophets and Messengers</h2>
                <p>Islam is a universal and inclusive religion. Muslims believe in the prophets, not just the Prophet
                    Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, but the Hebrew prophets, including Abraham
                    and Moses, as well as the prophets of the New Testament, Jesus, and John the Baptist. Islam teaches
                    God did not send prophets to Jews and Christians alone, rather He sent prophets to all nations in
                    the world with one central message: worship God alone. Muslims must believe in all prophets sent by
                    God mentioned in the Quran, without making any distinction between them. Muhammad was sent with the
                    final message, and there is no prophet to come after him. His message is final and eternal, and
                    through him God completed His Message to humanity.</p>
                <h2>4) Belief in the Sacred Texts</h2>
                <p>Muslims believe in all books that God has sent down to humanity through His prophets. These books
                    include the Books of Abraham, the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus
                    Christ. These books all had the same source (God), the same message, and all were revealed in truth.
                    This does not mean that they have been preserved in truth. Muslims (and many other Jewish and
                    Christian scholars and historians) find that the books in existence today are not the original
                    scriptures, which in fact have been lost, changed, and/or translated over and over again, losing the
                    original message.</p>
                <p>As Christians view the New Testament to fulfill and complete the Old Testament, Muslims believe that
                    the Prophet Muhammad received revelations from God through the angel Gabriel to correct human error
                    that had entered into the scriptures and doctrine of Judaism, Christianity and all other religions.
                    This revelation is the Quran, revealed in the Arabic language, and found today in its pristine form.
                    It seeks to guide mankind in all walks of life; spiritual, temporal, individual and collective. It
                    contains directions for the conduct of life, relates stories and parables, describes the attributes
                    of God, and speaks of the best rules to govern social life. It has directions for everybody, every
                    place, and for all time. Millions of people today have memorized the Quran, and all copies of the
                    Quran found today and in the past are identical. God has promised that He will guard the Quran from
                    change until the end of times, so that Guidance be clear to humanity and the message of all the
                    prophets be available for those who seek it.</p>

                <h2>5) Belief in Life after Death</h2>
                <p>Muslims believe that a day will come when all of creation will perish and resurrected in order to be
                    judged for their deeds: The Day of Judgment. On this day, all will gather in the presence of God and
                    each individual will be questioned about their life in the world and how they lived it. Those who
                    held correct beliefs about God and life, and followed their belief with righteous deeds will enter
                    Paradise, even though they may pay for some of their sins in Hell if God out of His Infinite Justice
                    chooses not to forgive them. As for those who fell into polytheism in its many faces, they will
                    enter Hellfire, never to leave therefrom.</p>

                <h2>6) Belief in the Divine Decree
                </h2>
                <p>Islam asserts that God has full power and knowledge of all things, and that nothing happens except by
                    His Will and with His full knowledge. What is known as divine decree, fate, or "destiny" is known in
                    Arabic as al-Qadr. The destiny of every creature is already known to God.</p>
                <p>This belief however does not contradict with the idea of man's free will to choose his course of
                    action. God does not force us to do anything; we can choose whether to obey or disobey Him. Our
                    choice is known to God before we even do it. We do not know what our destiny is; but God knows the
                    fate of all things.

                </p>
                <p>Therefore, we should have firm faith that whatever befalls us, it is according to God's will and with
                    His full knowledge. There may be things that happen in this world that we do not understand, but we
                    should trust that God has wisdom in all things.</p>
