                <h1>ISLAMIC WORSHIP</h1>
                <p>There are five simple but essential observances that all practicing Muslims accept and follow. These
                    “Pillars of Islam” represent the core that unites all Muslims.</p>
                <h2>1) The ‘Declaration of Faith’</h2>

                <p>A Muslim is one who testifies that “none deserves worship but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of
                    Allah.” This declaration is known as the “shahada” (witness, testimony). Allah is the Arabic name
                    for God, just as Yahweh is the Hebrew name for God. By making this simple proclamation one becomes a
                    Muslim. The proclamation affirms Islam’s absolute belief in the oneness of God, His exclusive right
                    to be worshipped, as well as the doctrine that associating anything else with God is the one
                    unforgivable sin as we read in the Koran:</p>
                <p class="quranVerse">“God does not forgive anyone for associating something with Him, while He does
                    forgive whomever He wishes to for anything else. Anyone who gives God partners has invented an awful
                    sin.” (Quran 4:48)</p>
                <p>The second part of the testimony of faith states that Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be
                    upon him, is a prophet of God like Abraham, Moses and Jesus before him. Muhammad brought the last
                    and final revelation. In accepting Muhammad as the “seal of the prophets,” Muslims believe that his
                    prophecy confirms and fulfills all of the revealed messages, beginning with Adam’s. In addition,
                    Muhammad serves as the role model through his exemplary life. A believer’s effort to follow
                    Muhammad’s example reflects the emphasis of Islam on practice and action.</p>

                <h2>2) The Prayer (Salah)</h2>
                <p>Muslims worship five times a day: at daybreak, noon, mid afternoon, sunset, and evening. It helps
                    keep believers mindful of God in the stress of work and family. It resets the spiritual focus,
                    reaffirms total dependence on God, and puts worldly concerns within the perspective of the last
                    judgment and the afterlife. The prayers consist of standing, bowing, kneeling, putting the forehead
                    on the ground, and sitting. The Prayer is a means in which a relationship between God and His
                    creation is maintained. It includes recitations from the Quran, praises of God, prayers for
                    forgiveness and other various supplications. The prayer is an expression of submission, humility,
                    and adoration of God. Prayers can be offered in any clean place, alone or together, in a mosque or
                    at home, at work or on the road, indoors or out. It is preferable to pray with others as one body
                    united in the worship of God, demonstrating discipline, brotherhood, equality, and solidarity. As
                    they pray, Muslims face Mecca, the holy city centered around the Kaaba - the house of God built by
                    Abraham and his son Ishmael.</p>

                <h2>3) The Compulsory Charity (Zakah)</h2>
                <p>In Islam, the true owner of everything is God, not man. People are given wealth as a trust from God.
                    Zakah is worship and thanksgiving to God by supporting the poor, and through it one’s wealth is
                    purified. It requires an annual contribution of 2.5 percent of an individual’s wealth and assets.
                    Therefore, Zakah is not mere “charity”, it is an obligation on those who have received their wealth
                    from God to meet the needs of less fortunate members of the community. Zakah is used to support the
                    poor and the needy, help those in debt, and, in olden times, to free slaves.</p>

                <h2>4) The Fast of Ramadan (Sawm)</h2>
                <p>Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar which is spent in fasting. Healthy Muslims
                    abstain from dawn to sunset from food, drink, and sexual activity. Fasting develops spirituality,
                    dependence upon God, and brings identification with the less fortunate. A special evening prayer is
                    also held in mosques in which recitations of the Quran are heard. Families rise before dawn to take
                    their first meal of the day to sustain them till sunset. The month of Ramadan ends with one of the
                    two major Islamic celebrations, the Feast of the Breaking of the Fast, called Eid al-Fitr, which is
                    marked by joyfulness, family visits, and exchanging of gifts.</p>

                <h2>5) The fifth Pillar is the Pilgrimage or Hajj to Mecca</h2>
                <p>At least once in a lifetime, every adult Muslim who is physically and financially able is required to
                    sacrifice time, wealth, status, and ordinary comforts of life to make the Hajj pilgrimage, putting
                    himself totally at God’s service. Every year over two million believers from a diversity of cultures
                    and languages travel from all over the world to the sacred city of Mecca[1] to respond to God’s
                    call.</p>
